# My-profile
I am a student software developer looking to increase my skills in software development. I have done projects in HTML, Javascript and CSS. 
I would like to participate in more projects in the future as I believe that I will increase my skills in that manner. I want to learn app development as well as web development and as such I am also interested in participating in hackathons and would love to team up.

I have developed an app, a game as well as a website in my learning journey. I am still new in the field and will also be looking for a mentor and will accept any advice regarding paths to follow in this career and how to better my skills.
